    <p>To allow your customers to name their own price for your product, simply enter "0+" as the price. Your customers can enter "0" to pay nothing, but if they choose to pay, they have to pay at least $0.99 (USD).</p>
    <p>If you'd like to set a lowest possible donation price, simply enter that number followed by "+"</p>

    <p>You can also set a "suggested" price that Customers will see when entering their donation amount. Change this by typing your price in the Suggested Amount box, then Save changes to make these settings go live.</p>

    <p>There are two ways to make a product free on Gumroad: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>You can use our PWYW feature and set a price of $0+ for your products, allowing customers to enter â€œ0" for the price and access your product for free. </li>
      <li>You can send customers a 100% off <a href="128-discount-codes">discount code</a>. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Note</b>: You cannot price a product at $0 without the PWYW feature, and they have a lower <a href="289-file-size-limits-on-gumroad">file-size limit</a>. We also don't take any <a href="66-gumroads-fees">fee</a> on free product sales.</p>
