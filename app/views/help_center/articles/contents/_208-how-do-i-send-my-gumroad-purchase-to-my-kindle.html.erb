    <p>If you've purchased a .mobi or a PDF file, you can send it to your Kindle directly from your Gumroad Library.</p>

If you have mistakenly purchased an ePub file and need a PDF, please <a href="195-theres-an-issue-with-my-purchase" target="_self">contact the creator</a>. Also, Gumroad can only send files 16 MB in size or smaller. If the "Send to Kindle" button is not appearing in your Library, please verify the size of the file you have purchased.</p>
