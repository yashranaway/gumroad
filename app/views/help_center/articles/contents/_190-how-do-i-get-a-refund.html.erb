    <p>When you buy a product from a Gumroad creator, Gumroad only processes payments on behalf of that creator. We allow creators on our platform to <a href="51-what-is-gumroads-refund-policy">set their own refund policies</a> and issue their own refunds to their customers (i.e. you!).</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, we can't issue an immediate refund unless the charge was <a href="https://gumroad.com/help/article/283-fraudulent-purchases">fraudulent</a> or a duplicate.</p>
    <p>Please write to us if you havenâ€™t heard back from the creator for 30 days since first contacting them, along with the proof of correspondence. We will reach out to them and will issue a refund if they continue to be unresponsive.</p>
    <p>If you have issues with the product you've purchased through Gumroad or feel you deserve a refund, you should contact the creator of the product. </p>
    <p>You can contact the creator by replying directly to your receipt email:</p>

    <p>or by looking at the "reply-to" information on your purchase email</p>

    <p>If you didn't receive a receipt, please first check the spam folder in your email inbox. If you still cannot find your receipt, please go through the steps <a href="212-i-never-received-a-receipt" target="_self">on this page</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="In-App-Purchases-GL6fX">In-App purchases</h3>
    <p>Refunds for in-app purchases are handled independently by Apple/Google support, so if you made a purchase on the <a href="177-the-gumroad-dashboard-app#Download-the-app-a0fEa">Gumroad mobile app</a>, neither the creator nor Gumroad can refund your purchase.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you need a refund for an in-app purchase, please contact <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/118223">Apple</a> (for IOS devices) or <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637?sjid=15689087848422407774-AP">Google support</a> (for Android devices).</p>
