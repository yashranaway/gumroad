    <p>To block problematic customers from purchasing your products, go to the Mass-block emails section in your <a href="https://gumroad.com/settings/advanced">Advanced Settings</a>. Enter one or more email addresses, separated by a new line, and click the Update settings button. </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Adding <em>SampleEmail@gmail.com</em> will also block <em>SampleEmail+1@gmail.com</em> and <em>Sample.Email@gmail.com</em>. This will only block customers from your Gumroad, and they will only know about it if they try to purchase from you again in the future. </p>
