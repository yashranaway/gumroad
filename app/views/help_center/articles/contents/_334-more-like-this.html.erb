    <p>Providing recommendations to your customers can bring awareness to other products offered in your store and motivate them to try out different items. </p>
    <br>
    <p>To update this setting:</p>

    <p>Now a grid of your products will be displayed on the buyer's checkout page. This won’t include products the buyer has already purchased or products currently in the buyer’s cart. </p>
    <p>Recommendations are based on purchases made by other buyers, so if the product has no purchasers in common with your other products, you won’t get any recommendations.</p>

    <p>Once a customer clicks on a recommended product, they will be directed to the product page where they can easily add it to their cart.</p>
    <h3>Recommending other products</h3>
    <p>You have the option of recommending other creators' products on your checkout page as well.</p>
