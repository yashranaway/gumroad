    <p> For all our Gumroad filmmakers allowing their customers to download video products, we highly recommend compressing your files before uploading them. By using the free software <a href="http://www.handbrake.fr/" target="_blank">Handbrake</a> you're guaranteed to find a great compromise between manageable file size and video quality. </p>

    <p> The basics of using Handbrake are as follows: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Click <strong>Source </strong>and select your file.</li>
      <li>Ensure the correct title (and chapters, if you have them) are selected from the Dropdown.</li>
      <li>Set the new output file name.</li>
      <li>Use the encoding presets to automatically set up all the required settings. We recommend <strong>Normal</strong> for watching on computers and TV.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Start </strong>to begin encoding!</li>
    </ol>
