    <p>Once you've made sales, use analytics to understand who your customers are and how they found you to help you reach out in the right places. We've designed our analytics platform to make it easy to understand and act on the data that matters.</p>
    <h3 id="Terms-to-know-UxK3S">Terms to know</h3>
    <h3>Conversion rate</h3>
    <p>A "conversion" happens when someone views your product and decides to buy it.</p>
    <p>Your conversion rate is the percentage of viewers who become buyers—for example, if 10 people view your product and 5 purchase, your conversion rate is 50%.</p>
    <h3>Direct sales</h3>
    <p>This will show up in your Analytics page as Direct, Email, IM, but this is, unfortunately, not the entire story. Here's a direct guide to the things that can mean "Direct":</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mobile devices or apps</li>
      <li>Email</li>
      <li>Twitter clients (Tweetdeck, Hootsuite, bit.ly, etc.)</li>
      <li>Instant messengers (Skype, Gchat, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="Diving-into-the-data-E-Y2C">Diving into the data</h3>
    <h3>Selecting products</h3>
    <p>By default, data for all of your products is shown in the <a href="https://gumroad.com/dashboard/sales">Sales Analytics Dashboard</a>. This allows you to get an overview of all your Gumroad products.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to dig deeper into the sales of a particular product (or group of products), you can select the products you'd like to view by clicking the drop-down filter from the top of the page.</p>
    <p>You can also toggle data for your product selections by clicking "Toggle selected" at the bottom of the filter list.</p>
    <figure><%= image_tag "https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5c4657ad2c7d3a66e32d763f/images/62469212c1e53608cf9ef35d/file-Hq8M9GB3iH.png" %></figure>
    <h3>Selecting the date range</h3>
    <p>By default, analytics shows data from the past month; however, it's often necessary to view sales data over a more extended period. From the date picker in the top right, you can access any range of data you'd like to view, going back to your first sale.</p>
    <p>The data in the sales chart, referrer list, and location will be updated to reflect the period you choose.</p>
    <figure><%= image_tag "https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5c4657ad2c7d3a66e32d763f/images/64bf9636a9d61472afe09529/file-5EEqngjHHA.png" %></figure>
    <p>You can also toggle between daily and monthly views to get the best of both analytic worlds: the close-up and the big picture.</p>
    <h3>Sales chart</h3>
    <p>Sales data for the period you've selected is shown as a combined graph. Each bar represents a single day. The light grey section of the bar represents the number of views.</p>
    <p>A line graph of sales volume is overlaid on top to give you a sense of sales volume relative to your views.</p>
    <p>Hover on any day to see more information about the sales, views, and absolute sales value in dollars.</p>
    <figure><%= image_tag "https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5c4657ad2c7d3a66e32d763f/images/6246932342ba434a7afe2278/file-V5ESJfaXNp.png" %></figure>
    <h3 id="Referrers-WBsBP">Referrers</h3>
    <p>A referrer is the original source of a visit to your product. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you share a link to your product on Twitter and a customer follows the link to your product page, the referrer would be Twitter. Similarly, </li>
      <li>If someone searches for your product on Google and then visits your product page, the referrer will be Google.For sales made through Gumroad Discover, the referrer will be listed as "Recommended by Gumroad."</li>
      <li>If the referrer is just "Gumroad," this indicates that the customer first visited another page on Gumroad (not via Discover) before viewing your product.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All referrers to the selected product are shown in the referrers list. The number of views, purchases, and conversion percentage, as well as the absolute dollar amount of sales for each referrer, are shown here. You can sort this list by any of these metrics.</p>
    <figure><%= image_tag "https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5c4657ad2c7d3a66e32d763f/images/624693d2c1688a6d26a7c11f/file-Zfg8pFmBDi.png" %></figure>
    <h3 id="Locations-PoKPf">Locations</h3>
    <p>To help you learn about your following, we show the approximate location of your customers in a table based on the IP of the purchase.</p>
    <p>You can see the views, the number of sales, and the dollar amount sold from each location in the country. You can also sort the table based on those columns.</p>
    <p>If you're in the U.S., we also allow you to switch to the 'United States' view from the 'World' view by clicking on the drop-down on the right. This will enable you to see the breakdown from the different states. At this time, we only show state-specific sales in the United States.</p>

    <h3 id="sales-csv">Exporting a customer sales CSV</h3>
    <p>You can download a CSV file of your customers and their purchases within a selected date range from the <a href="https://gumroad.com/customers">Sales tab</a>. This CSV will cover all sales of your products within the date range, or you can choose to download information about a single product. If the CSV is not immediately available for download, it will be emailed to you. </p>
    <p>Note: Your Gumroad Analytics and Customers dashboards use your local time zone to display and filter orders. However, your CSV uses UTC time (Coordinated Universal Time). We recommend that you add a one-day buffer to the beginning and end of your date range before exporting to ensure that you capture all orders.</p>
    <h3>All products</h3>
    <p>For information on all sales within a specific date range, click the  <strong>Export</strong> icon, select a <strong>Date Range</strong>, and click <strong>Download</strong>.  </p>

    <h3 id="utm-link-tracking">UTM Link Tracking</h3>
    <p>UTM link tracking allows you to track where your customers are coming from and measure the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns.</p>
    <h3>Enabling UTM Link Tracking</h3>
    <p>Creators can enable UTM link tracking in Gumroad by following these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to <a href="https://gumroad.com/dashboard/utm_links">Analytics → Links</a>.</li>
      <li>Click "Create link" and enter a "Destination" such as their Profile page, Subscribe page, a product page, or a post page.</li>
      <li>Add UTM parameters like Source, Medium, Campaign, etc., to track visitor origins.</li>
      <li>Once the UTM link is created, copy either the Short link or UTM link from the UTM link dashboard and share it with their audience.</li>
      <li>When someone clicks the UTM link, Gumroad records a unique click, and if a purchase is made within 7 days, it is attributed to that UTM link.</li>
      <li>To analyze performance, click on a UTM link in your dashboard to see Clicks, Sales, Revenue, and Conversion rate.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Important Notes on UTM Links</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If the destination is a specific product page, only purchases of that product will be attributed to the UTM link.</li>
      <li>If the destination is a profile page, subscribe page, or a post page, purchases of any products will be attributed, regardless of which product is purchased.</li>
    </ul>
