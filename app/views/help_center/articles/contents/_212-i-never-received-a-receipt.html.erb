    <p>If you can't locate a receipt in your inbox, it is either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In your Spam folder.</li>
      <li>In another Inbox. You may have used a different email during checkout (emails linked with PayPal or Apple/Google Pay are the usual culprits). You can check the email address that you used <a href="https://gumroad.com/charge">here</a>.</li>
      <li>If the above page can't find a match, there's most likely a typo in the email address used at checkout. <a href="196-contact-gumroad" target="_self">Contact us</a> with the following purchase details:</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>If it's a purchase on a credit card</h3>
    <p>If the charge was on your credit card, you should email us with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The last 4 digits of the card</li>
      <li>The expiration date (MM/YYYY)</li>
      <li>The card type (e.g. MasterCard/Visa/American Express, etc.)</li>
      <li>The charge amount (in USD) and charge date</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>If it's a purchase made with PayPal</h3>
    <p>Go to your PayPal transaction invoice and look for an “Invoice ID” on the page, that looks like a series of numbers and letters, followed by two equal signs, for example in this image, it's <code class="inline-code">GliB1-mnSPZUYwPX_oB34vQ==</code></p>

    <p>If that were your invoice ID, simply plug that into this URL: </p>
    <p>https://www.gumroad.com/purchases/ <strong> [ Invoice ID] </strong>/ receipt </p>
    <p>So, using the above example, you would get this:</p>
    <figure><%= image_tag "https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5c4657ad2c7d3a66e32d763f/images/5c6dd661042863543ccd404a/file-uc1ykwT8gh.png" %></figure>
    <p>You'll be sent directly to your receipt, with a download link and an invoice link.</p>
