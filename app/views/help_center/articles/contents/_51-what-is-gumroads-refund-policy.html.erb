    <p>Every seller has their own unique needs and principles when it comes to issuing refunds, therefore Gumroad allows and encourages its sellers to <a href="335-custom-refund-policy">set their own refund policies</a>.</p>
    <p>That said, Gumroad reserves the right to issue refunds within 90 days of purchase, at its discretion, to prevent chargebacks.</p>
    <p>That said, you can set a "no-refunds" policy, but card networks still allow customers to file <a href="134-how-does-gumroad-handle-chargebacks">chargebacks</a> at any time. <strong>Too many successful disputes can put your Gumroad account at risk of suspension</strong>, even if your policy is clearly stated. </p>
    <p>If a customer is threatening a chargeback, we recommend that you offer them a <a href="47-how-to-refund-a-customer#partial">partial refund</a> using the feature we've provided you with. </p>
