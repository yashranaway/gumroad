    <p>Every time a new customer purchases a product from your Gumroad, their email address and other details are added to your <a href="https://gumroad.com/customers">Sales</a> dashboard. You can review all of your customers and manage your customer information from this page. </p>
    <h3 id="Search-and-Filter-5a7fG">Search and Filter</h3>
    <p>You can search for a customerâ€™s name, if given, or email address directly by selecting the magnifying glass on the upper right-hand side. </p>
    <figure><%= image_tag "https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5c4657ad2c7d3a66e32d763f/images/62151893db4c3c5ea2ebfe9b/file-hb7q6qx7On.png" %></figure>
    <p>You have the option to filter your customers based on the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>what they have or haven't bought </li>
      <li>price</li>
      <li>purchase date </li>
      <li>country</li>
      <li>if they're an active customer. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>An active customer is someone who is not refunded and has not unsubscribed from the product. </p>

    <h3 id="Discover-or-Offer-codes-Ij0xL">Discover or Discount codes</h3>
    <p>Right below the product title, you're able to see if a Customer found this product via <a href="79-gumroad-discover">Discover</a> or if a <a href="https://gumroad.com/help/article/128-discount-codes">Discount code</a> was used. </p>
    <figure><%= image_tag "https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5c4657ad2c7d3a66e32d763f/images/621520b73271e31797cf0fd7/file-najTuXeRCf.png" %></figure>
    <h3 id="Edit-a-customers-email-address-fJhCO">Edit a customer's email address</h3>
    <p>If your customer has mistyped their email address when purchasing your product or needs to change their mailing information, you can fix this for them. Click the "Edit" button next to the email, edit it, and save your changes. </p>
    <p>We do not allow creators to edit customers' email addresses if they created a Gumroad account during their purchase. Please reach out to support@gumroad.com in this case. </p>
    <p>You can also select if a customer receives your <a href="169-how-to-send-an-update">emails</a> or not.</p>
    <figure><%= image_tag "https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5c4657ad2c7d3a66e32d763f/images/62166eba1173d072c69fb117/file-prFEDMObGA.gif" %></figure>
    <h3 id="Tiers-versions-and-variants-5tqxu">Tiers, versions, and variants</h3>
    <p>Depending on the product, you can reassign your customer to a different tier or version. </p>
    <p>This does not charge or refund the customer, it simply changes their product type and the files they receive.</p>
    <figure><%= image_tag "https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5c4657ad2c7d3a66e32d763f/images/62171f7a1c416e446e804223/file-n9069uPZRk.png" %></figure>
    <h3 id="Manage-license-keys-5AuIs">Manage license keys</h3>
    <p>You can disable a <a href="76-license-keys">license key</a> or change the number of seats for a multi-seat license key.</p>
    <p>Customers will immediately be charged a prorated amount if the number of seats is increased. However, for a decrease in the number of seats, their membership will get updated at the end of the current billing cycle, and they will be charged the reduced amount for subsequent renewals.</p>

    <h3 id="Shipping-information-l476B">Shipping information</h3>
    <p>You can mark a physical product as being shipped and enter tracking information in the dashboard. You need to enter the full URL of the tracking order, not just the tracking ID. </p>

    <h3 id="Ratings-HLwRM">Ratings</h3>
    <p>You can see how a customer has rated your product. If you're unhappy with your ratings, you can hide all of <a href="222-product-ratings-on-gumroad">them</a> from being visible or refund the customer to automatically delete their rating.  You cannot hide a single rating only.</p>

    <h3 id="Refund-a-customer-tQVdX">Refund a customer</h3>
    <p>You can <a href="47-how-to-refund-a-customer">refund a customer</a> from the dashboard as well. If you only want to issue a partial refund, type in the amount you want to refund and hit "Issue partial refund".</p>

    <h3 id="Resend-posts-workflow-emails-and-receipts-l2OYk">Resend posts, workflow emails, and receipts</h3>
    <p>You can resend <a href="169-how-to-send-an-update">emails</a>, <a href="131-using-workflows-to-send-automated-updates">workflow emails</a>, and receipts at the bottom of this section.

If the CSV is not immediately available for download, it will be emailed to you. This CSV will cover all sales of your products within the date range, or you can choose to download information pertaining to a single product.  Please note that <a href="#Search-and-Filter-5a7fG">any filters</a> you applied to this page will not apply to the export.</p>
