    <p> Gumroad offers a variety of security measures to keep your content safe:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All download links are unique</li>
      <li>Purchaser IP addresses are tracked and we ask for the buyer's email address if they attempt to access the link from a different location.</li>
      <li>Streaming-only for videos allows for a high level of protection because the file is never downloaded to the buyer's computer or device. The signed, expired, and tracked links for streaming prevent file sharing.</li>
      <li><a href="130-pdf-stamping" target="_blank">PDF Stamping</a> allows you to stamp your ebook or other written file (in PDF format) with a beautiful graphic of your buyer's email address, acting as a strong deterrent to widespread sharing.</li>
    </ul>
