    <p> Creators are typically paid every Friday for all sales <strong>not</strong> made through PayPal (<a href="13-getting-paid">here's how payouts work</a>). However, payouts can sometimes be delayed—see reasons below. If yours is delayed by more than one Friday, please <a href="mailto:support@gumroad.com">email us</a>. </p>
    <h3>Reason 1: You haven't been reviewed yet</h3>
    <figure><%= image_tag "https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5c4657ad2c7d3a66e32d763f/images/63e57a8bd2459a27d10c91e4/file-UfndQSL5SI.png" %></figure>
    <p> When you sell products on Gumroad, we handle payments and take on the legal and financial responsibility for your products on behalf of our banking partners. This is a core part of Gumroad: we deal with banks, credit cards, and PayPal so you can focus on creating. </p>
    <p> In order to do business with you, we have to be sure that your products are legitimate and safe to sell. For this, we need data about your sales. We look for proof that your products are real, your customers are receiving what they paid for, and your sales don't raise red flags with our payment partners or pose a risk to our bottom line. For a list of products you cannot sell on Gumroad, <a href="155-things-you-cant-sell-on-gumroad">read our guidelines here</a>. </p>
    <p> Once we confirm this, we mark your account as "compliant," notify our banking partners that you're approved, and begin paying out your earnings.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Cool story. So, why is my account still not reviewed?</em></strong></p>
    <p> So - some background: </p>
    <p><strong>Fraudsters</strong> are constantly testing out Gumroad as a means of laundering money, and they are <em>very good</em> at mimicking legitimate products and sales. We catch a few hundred of these accounts every month during the risk review process. As a result of these malicious actors, we have to be <em>extremely</em> cautious and thorough in our risk reviews.</p>
    <p>Your account is still in the review process because we likely don't have enough data from your account. Your sales have not yet demonstrated that your account can be supported, so we are not yet able to hand you over to our banking partners.</p>
    <p> For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You may not have enough sales</li>
      <li>Some of your sales may appear suspicious from a risk standpoint</li>
      <li>The sales you have made are not legitimate (i.e. you've been buying your own products) </li>
      <li>You may have made multiple sales, but they're all to the same person</li>
      <li>It's unclear what exactly your customers are paying you for (i.e. we're not sure if your products violate our Terms of Service)</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Whatever the reason, we have not been able to confidently review your sales and hand you over to our banking partners. </p>
    <p><strong>How to verify this: <br>
      </strong>If you go to <a href="http://www.gumroad.com/balance">your balance page</a> and see a message that your account is under review (see above), that means your account is still under review.  </p>
    <p><strong>What to do: <br>
      </strong>We kindly ask that you wait until you've made 2-3 more sales, then email us for clarification. We cannot speed up the review for you, and we cannot provide everyone with <em>specific</em> information about why their account hasn't been reviewed, but we can at least answer the questions that you have. </p>
    <h3> Reason 2: There's an issue with your bank or PayPal account </h3>
    <p> It's also possible that we <em>have</em> been attempting to send money to your bank, or your PayPal account, but they are blocking the money. You may have entered incorrect information in your <a href="http://gumroad.com/settings/payments">Payment Settings</a>, or there may be a lock on your PayPal account. </p>
    <p><strong>What to do:</strong><br>
      Email us and we can look into it for you.</p>
    <h3>Reason 3: There is an issue with your account </h3>
    <p> If this is the case, you may have received an email from us telling you that we were unable to pay you. You would have received this email because your account was skipped during payouts due to a security issue, a compliance issue, or a problem with your payout settings. It's usually nothing to worry about, but the email can be a little scary sometimes.  </p>
    <p><strong>What to do:</strong><br>
      Email us and we can look into it for you.</p>
    <h3>Reason 4: There is an issue with your verification</h3>
    <figure><%= image_tag "help_center/stripe-verification-ui.png" %></figure>
    <p>Payouts may be paused by our payment processor if you have not completed your account's identity or business verification. You can check your <a href="https://gumroad.com/settings/payments">Payment Settings</a> page for details on what is missing or why your verification is failing.</p>
    <h3>Reason 5: Your payouts are paused</h3>
    <p>Your payouts may be paused by the Gumroad administrator for a security review or if there is any unusual activity detected on the account. You can check your <a href="https://gumroad.com/settings/payments">Payment Settings</a> page for details on why your payouts have been paused.</p>
    <h3>Reason 6: Today <em>might not</em> actually be your pay day</h3>
    <p> We often have creators write in asking why they had not been paid on a Friday, and when we investigate the situation we see that they were not, in fact, supposed to have received money. </p>
    <p> As per <a href="13-getting-paid">Getting Paid</a>, we pay out every Friday for all sales made <em>up to the previous Friday</em>. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sales made from <strong>June 1–7</strong> would be paid out on <strong>Friday, June 14</strong></li>
      <li>Sales made from <strong>June 8–14</strong> would be paid out on <strong>Friday, June 21</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p> In other words, that means the money sent out to you on a Friday has to have come from a sale that is <em>at least 7 days old</em>. If you make a sale on a Tuesday, you would not be receiving the profits from that sale three days later, unfortunately. You would have to wait until the following Friday to be paid out. In visual terms: </p>

    <h3>Reason 7: Your sales are not legitimate (or made by yourself)</h3>
    <p> Another reason your account may be stuck in review is that you are purchasing your own products. We understand you might do this to "test" our payment system or to boost your products on Discover, but purchases made by the creator are not considered legitimate sales, so they do not get paid out even after reaching a $10 balance. Our banking partners view these transactions as a form of money laundering, and we are required to refund them when we find them. </p>
    <p> Only sales made by real customers count as legitimate, and we only process payouts for those. To get paid, focus on making real sales to real customers. </p>
