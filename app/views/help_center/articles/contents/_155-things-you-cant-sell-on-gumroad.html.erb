    <p>While Gumroad allows for a huge variety of products to be sold, we do have to delete products from time to time, and we suggest all new creators read through this list to make sure their accounts are in compliance. </p>
    <p>In general, we do not allow reselling - you cannot resell products that you didn't create. You can be an affiliate for another Gumroad creator - but you cannot sell products that didn't spring forth from your own beautiful mind.</p>
    <p>We do not allow any activity or content that promotes or encourages discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age. This includes any content sent out using our email services, or as part of any products sold on Gumroad in any capacity.</p>

      <li>Incite violence against a specific person, place, or group</li>
      <li>Share private information about a citizen without their permission</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Dealing with violation of our Terms</h3>
    <p>If you share, promote, or sell content that violates the guidelines listed above, it is a violation of our Terms of Service. </p>
    <p>Depending on the situation, we may be forced to suspend your account and refund your sales. This is our prerogative as detailed in section 11.3 of <a href="https://gumroad.com/terms" target="_blank">our Terms</a>.</p>
    <p>But if that is not the case, and we are able to pay you:</p>
