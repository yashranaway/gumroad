    <h3 id="FAQs-bQduz">FAQs</h3>
    <p><b>Q: Why doesn't my purchase show up in the app?</b></p>
    <p>A: It is possible that the product you purchased is not mobile-friendly. For example, a ZIP file might need to be opened on your desktop. Or a Mobi file. Essentially, the product does not contain a file that can be read, watched, or listened to on our app. </p>
    <p><b>Q: Files are missing from my library!</b></p>
    <p>A: Email Gumroad's Support team from the email address you purchased with, and mention the name of the missing product in your email. We will gladly add this product manually to your library! If the file is not mobile-friendly, however, we cannot add it to your library.</p>
